SHORT DESCRIPTION:
Nior is a casual 2D platformer that focuses on simple jumping and stabbing mechanics.
Players have to hop across platforms to collect a key in order to unlock the next area.
In addition, players have to fight skeletons that can hurt the player even after death.
-------------------------
KNOWN BUGS:
• No sound
• Skeletons will get stuck against the wall
• Health will reset upon scene change
-------------------------
EXPERIENCE:
The experience that the designer wants the player to feel is mild anxiety and a casual sense of excitement.
The game is not intended to be very difficult and the combat is designed to be very simple and straightforward.
The graphics are also designed to be somewhat cute in order to develop some sense of attachment between the player and the knight.
